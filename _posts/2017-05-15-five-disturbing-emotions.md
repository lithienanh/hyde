1. [Ignorance](#ignorance)
2. [Attachment](#attachment)
3. [Anger](#anger)
4. [Jealousy](#jealousy)
5. [Pride](#pride)

## Ignorance

### Cause 

The unenlighted mind perceives everything else relatively well, but it cannot see itself. This creates a wrong percepetion of duality, or separation between oneself and others, which becomes the root of all our problems. We mistake the our body, thoughts, emotions are real and solid, and then think, say, and act accordingly to that wrong assumption. We usually just go from one experience to the next, among which some are pleasant, and some are not. Since we cannot clearly see the results of our actions until they appear, we might cause troubles. It is like playing chess without knowing all the rules.

> We sometimes forget that we planted the cactus that we are sitting on right now.

### Solution

The ultimate solution is to meditate and practice until we obtain the non-dualistic view, and see the way things are. We should watch our mind closely and act in accordance with the laws of cause and effect. In the mean time, if we do not have enough clarity in a situation, we should do what we would like others to do for ourselves in that case. Another advice is "First though, best thought". One should spend less time in unproductive situtations, and avoid over-analyzing.

> Let thoughts and feelings run by without evaluation, like the news ticker running on the bottom of the TV.

## Attachment

### Cause

Everyone wants to be happy, but we usually look for it in something outside, like houses, cars, partners, etc. Unfortunately, after obtaining the desired objects, one realize it is not a lasting happiness. The underlying reason is that things are impermanent, the object changes, and so do ourselves. Instead of enjoying what is there, people try to get more in the hope for happiness. Although attachment and desire at a moderate level can be motivative, exccessive attachments limit our potential and create stiffness.

> Greedy mindset makes people fundamentallly poor even when their mattress is stuffed with money. 

### Solution

We should try to understand and always remind ourselves about the impermanence of everything composite. There is only one timeless happiness, which is knowing our mind, and we should focus our time and energy on that. It is said that generosity is the best antidote for attachment. By sharing the relative joy with others, we can open up our minds and break down our concepts. We should enjoy every moment instead of clinging to our past habits and expectations.

> The more we focus on ourselves, the more problems we have. The more we focus on others, the more interesting things to do.

## Anger

### Cause

Anger develops from the ego wanting to protect itself when dealing with something unpleasant. People looks at mistakes and limitations instead of the richness and possibilities of the situation. The biggest misunderstanding is that anger is a sign of strength and power. In fact, anger is a sign of weakness, vulnerability, and fear. Moreover, anger is considered the most harmful emotion, since it bubbles up very quickly and it can burn many good impressions if one act on it.

> Weak people get frustrated. Strong people just do what they want.

### Solution

We should try to notice the first symptom of anger and deal with it right away. The best approach is to transform the situation through understanding and compassion. We remind ourselves that everyone looks for happiness, but sometimes they make mistakes out of ignorance. When dealing with difficult people, one should look for their strengths and potentials. We should also remember the current situtation is the result of our previous thoughts, words, and actions. Thus, we should  deal with it now rather than later, and try to see them as funny animals leaving the zoo. It is said that patience is the best antidote for anger. Instead of speaking or acting during the heat of anger, we should observe the disturbing emotion appear then dissappear in our mind. If there is not enough space, just leave the situation. Finally, one should be thankful since difficult situations are opportunities for growth and development.

> It wasn't here five minutes ago. It will be here five minutes from now. So why worry about it now?

## Jealousy

### Cause

Jealousy is probably the most peculiar and uselss disturbing emotion, since it is not realted to an immediate action or concrete situation. One becomes unhappy because of the happiness of others. The fundamental reason here is confusion, which prevent ones from seeing cause and effect clearly. We think somehow it is unfair that others are happy while we are not, and their happiness is the cause of our suffering. Jealousy is when the ego tries to blame someone else or outside situation for our current state.

> Jealousy is like drinking poison, and expect the other person to die.

### Solution

Our current situation is totally depended on our previous thoughts, words, and actions, and so does everyone else. There is no one else but ourselves that are responsible for our current circumstance. Thus, we should focus on developing our own abilities, and accumulating surplus. Then we can be clear of the causes of our jealousy and eliminate them. The ultimate level is to wish all happiness for the person we are jealous of.

> Our previous thoughts, words, and actions become our current state. And right now we are sowing the seeds for our future.

## Pride

### Cause

Pride is the idea of being better than others, which originates from the dualistic view. We think we are the center of the universe, and everything else is happening around us. We assume our experience, thoughts, and feelings are so special and unique that no one can understand it better than ourselves. Then, we can only notice others' shortcomings and imperfections, which is the primary cause for loneliness and inability of joy.

> One usually apply too much compassion for ourselves, and too much wisdom for others.

### Solution

If we see that others are inspiring and clever, then we are always in good company and joy. Instead of their imperfections, we see their abilities and potentials which we can also learn from. The best antidote is to remember the enlightened esence of all beings, which create the inclusive pride among all. Instead of comparing and judging each other, we share, develop and grow together.

> Look what we can do!
