title: Five Disturbing Emotions
---

## 1. Ignorance

### Cause 

The unenlighted mind perceives everything else relatively well, but it cannot see itself. This creates a wrong percepetion of duality, or separation between oneself and others. We mistake the our body, thoughts, emotions are real and solid, and just go from one experience to the next, among which some are pleasant, and some are not. Since we cannot clearly see the results of our words and actions until they appear, we might cause troubles. It is like playing chess without knowing all the rules.

> We sometimes forget that we planted the cactus that we are sitting on right now.

### Solution

* Meditation and practice to obtain the non-dualistic view. 
* Watching our mind closely and act in accordance with the laws of cause and effect.

### Interim solution

* Do what one would like others to do for oneself.
* First though, best thought. Spend less time in unproductive situtations, and avoid over-analyzing.
* Let thoughts and feelings run by without evaluation, like the news ticker running on the bottom of the TV.

## 2. Attachment

### Cause

Everyone wants to be happy, but one usually look for it in something outside, like the house, car, partner, etc. However, after obtaining the desired object, one realize it is not a lasting happiness. Because things are impermanent, the object changes, and so does oneself. Instead of enjoy what is there, people try to get more, in the hope for happiness. At a moderate level, attachment and desire can be motivative. However, exccessive attachments limit our potential and create stiffness.

> Greedy mindset makes people fundamentallly poor even when their mattress is stuffed with money. 

### Solution

* Notice and understand the impermanence of everything composite
* Working towards the timeless happiness of enlightenment

### Interim solution

* Generosity, share the relative joy with others
* Enjoy the moment instead of clinging to past habits and expectations

## 3. Anger

### Cause

Anger develops from the ego wanting to protect itself when dealing with something unpleasant. People looks at mistakes and limitations instead of the richness and possibilities of the situation. Anger is not a sign of strength, it is a sign of weakness, vulnerability, and fear.

> Weak people get frustrated. Strong people just do what they want.

Anger is considered the most harmful emotion, since it bubbles up very quickly and it can burn many good impressions if one act on it.

### Solution

* Notice the first symptom and transform the situation through understanding or compassion. Everyone looks for happiness, but sometimes they make mistakes out of ignorance.
* Patience is the best antidote for anger. When dealing with difficult people, one should look for their strengths and potentials. 

### Interim solution

* It is never wise to speak or act during the heat of anger. Leave the situation if there is not enough space.
* The current situtation is the result of our previous thoughts, words, and actions. We should  deal with it now rather than later. Try to see them as funny animals leaving the zoo.
* One should be thankful since difficult situations are opportunities for growth and development.
